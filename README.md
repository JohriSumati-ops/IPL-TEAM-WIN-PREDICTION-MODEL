# IPL-TEAM-WIN-PREDICTION-MODEL
This project predicts IPL Team win probability using Logistic Regression and OneHotEncoder through pipeline algorithm of Machine Learning model. RandomForestClassifier provides wider and bit by bit result unlike LR which provided a smooth workflow and real-life based probabilities. This model bridged the gap between data science and deployment.
